Ionic + Firebase Seed App
=========================

This is a seed application to help you get started building apps with [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/) and Firebase. Using [AngularFire](https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/libraries/angular/), this app implements email / password authentication and adds messages to a synchronized array. The app is built using the [Ionic CLI](http://ionicframework.com/docs/cli/).

### Getting Started

To run this app you need to have the Ionic CLI installed. You can install it by running:

`npm install -g ionic`

Once you have the CLI installed, clone this repo and run the app locally with the command:

`ionic serve`

Replace `FBURL` with the URL of your own Firebase.

### How it Works

Since Ionic is built on top of Angular, this seed application uses AngularFire.

### Securing your app

This seed app has very basic security rules to ensure that only logged in users can add messages to the list. You can see them in the `rules.json` file. For more details on security rules, check out the [security quickstart](https://www.firebase.com/docs/security/quickstart.html) in our documentation.
